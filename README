Image is an image-drawing with a few drawing primitives (circles, ellipses, lines, rectangles, text). It currently has code for "dumping" an image to either X11 drawables or GIF files (via Skippy). It currently only has a single font available for drawing text, but it should be possible to extend the font handling to load fonts from other formats.
